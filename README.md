# TODO List App

This is a [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) project which is my first project in Express.js world. It's a simple TODO list app and bootstraped with [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) and use [EJS](https://ejs.co) as the template engine.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [Nodemon](https;//nodemon.io) when you start the development, nodemon show you anything that happens in the terminal.
